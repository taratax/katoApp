Spodek (meaning &quot;saucer&quot; in Polish) is a multipurpose arena complex in Katowice, Poland, opened in 1971 at ul. Korfantego 35 under the name Wojewódzka Hala Widowiskowo-Sportowa w Katowicach (Voivodeship Sport and Show Arena in Katowice), under which it is known in the Polish technical/architectural literature, and under which it formally functioned until 1997.

Aside from the main dome, the complex includes a gym, an ice rink, a hotel and three large car parks. It was the largest indoor venue of its kind in Poland until it was surpassed by Kraków Arena in 2014. It hosts many important cultural and business events. Music concerts are especially common non-sport events. Spodek can hold 11,500 people, although this number is in practice limited to 10,000 or even 8,000 due to stage set-ups obscuring the view. Its Polish name refers to a flying saucer (its shape resembles a UFO). Spodek is a major contribution to the cultural significance of Katowice in Poland, especially for the younger generations. It has also been used as an unofficial logo for the city on posters promoting redevelopment in Katowice. Spodek is home to HC GKS Katowice ice hockey club in the winter months.</string>

The new home of the National Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra, one of the most cutting edge and distinguished cultural buildings in Poland opened on 1st October, 2014 in Katowice. The project was completed in an impressive two and half years with BuroHappold Engineering’s partner, Ian Booth, and project leaders, Sławomir Pastuszka and Paweł Lisiak, present at the inauguration ceremony.
With a capacity of almost 1,800, this world class concert hall’s acoustics met the highest standards applied by world-renowned acoustic consulting firm, Nagata Acoustics. To ensure the compliance with these standards, a 1/10-scale model study was carried out to confirm the hall’s acoustics in the laboratory environment designed initially using acoustic computer modelling.
BuroHappold’s structural and mechanical engineering solutions enabled the building to meet acoustics requirements for this unique construction. The noise emitted by ventilation units was reduced to a minimum to allow undisturbed concerts and studio recordings. To achieve this effect, the ventilation facility was relocated outside the building, while inside the concert hall wooden displacement air diffusers were employed, especially designed for the building’s needs. Sound distribution from one room to another was reduced to a minimum thanks to the supplying of utilities via facade pilasters.
To insulate the concert hall against the noise produced outside, it was surrounded by an atrium and auxiliary rooms: rehearsal rooms, dressing rooms and a chamber music hall able to hold an audience of 300 people. For the same reason, all the walls and roofing were made of reinforced concrete. The designers proposed using black tinted concrete for the concert hall walls, which refers to the Silesian mining tradition.
Working closely with our client, our structural and mechanical &amp; electrical teams brought global knowledge to the project to enhance the audience experience, making the concert hall a leading venue for music in Poland.
Warsaw based partner, Ian Booth stated: “We are extremely honoured to have taken part in such a marvellous cultural venue creation and contribute to Polish prime buildings being recognisable on an international stage. The project was a great challenge, that’s why I feel extremely satisfied and proud to see how the fruits of BuroHappold’s work impress the audience.”</string>

Supposedly the largest and heaviest monument in Poland, this vast bronze edifice is one of Katowice&apos;s most famous landmarks, commemorating the three post-WWI Polish armed uprisings against the German authorities of Upper Silesia in 1919, 1920 and 1921. The monument symbolizes the heroism and sacrifice of the insurgents with an enormous bronze wing for each uprising. Designed by Gustaw Zemła and erected on the site of the city&apos;s Red Army cemetery in 1967, the monument was assembled from 350 parts and weighs a hulking 61 tonnes. The highest wing reaches 14 metres tall, making it one of the ‘tallest monuments in PL’ behind the 36m Monument of Christ the King in Świebodzin and the 32-metre high Wujek memorial cross on the other side of town (and probably a dozen other monuments in the country).</string>

Until recently, one could easily be forgiven for standing in the middle of the market square and trying to find the market square. The massive construction works are finally finished and the snazzy new Rynek 2.0 complete with a flowing river, deck chairs and palm trees is open for business just in time for the summer festival season. Before the massive overhaul (and we mean massive!), Katowice&apos;s &apos;Rynek&apos; was basically a large traffic roundabout and tram stop surrounded by a faded collection of mismatched buildings in architectural styles that had mostly fallen out of favour, if they ever engendered any enthusiasm to begin with. For years the city has known that turning its market square into, you know, an actual market square, would be a crucial step toward becoming a respectable Polish city. A plan to modernise and pedestrianise the Rynek was put in place as far back as 2008. The first step was modernising the Soviet-era monstrosity at ul. Młyńska that uglied up an entire block of the Rynek and they elegantly transformed it into the new modern City Hall. All work has now been completed including the re-routing of the entire Silesian tram network through the &apos;new&apos; Rynek (check new tram schedule here rozklady.kzkgop.pl - there is an English version).</string>

The Kosciuszko Park, which has existed since 1925, is one of the most famous and frequented parks in Katowice, Poland. It is situated at the street of the same name.
Its foundation dates back to 1888 when a municipal park was founded on the 6 ha area of suburban grove. The present area of the park is 72 ha. Its arrangement is influenced by English gardens-parks, which is emphasized by an alley of roses turned to wild. The park used to belong to the most beautiful places in Katowice, also because of the flower arrangements on the flower-beds and pergolas and classicistic gardens. After dusk the park is lit by stylish street lamps but it is not a safe part of the town in the evening.
In the park there are several structures which are worth seeing. There is a commemorative plaque funded for the patron, Tadeusz Kościuszko, by the people of Katowice in 1925. The parachute tower also dates back to that time. It is currently being rebuilt to its height of 40 m; it was erected as a training structure. Not far from it there is a monument commemorating the heroic participation of scouts in the defence of the town against the Nazi invaders in 1939. Two unique structures of wooden building in Upper Silesia, a manorial granary from 1688 (burnt in 1970) and the Church of St. Michael Archangel, a wooden church under the invocation of St. Michael from 1510 moved from Syrynia, were placed in the park. In the park there is also a permanent gallery of plein-air sculpture, collecting works of famous artists of the region: Zygmunt Brachmanski, Augustyn Dyrda, Joachim Krakowczyk, Piotr Latoska, Jacek Sarapata, Andrzej Szczepaniec.
In winter children can use a toboggan track and a ski route. The Soviet soldiers who died in 1945 are also buried there. The Park Hall, erected in the 1950s, is situated opposite the park and holds 3.500 people. In the past it used to be a place of many interesting cultural performances. At present it is a grocery/supermarket. Nearby there is a military cemetery from the interbellum. At no great distance towards the centre there is a sports stadium of the Physical Training Academy.</string>
			<string>Jewish cemetery in Katowice (Kozielska 16 street) was built in 1868. Those who died before building it were burried on the Jewish cemetery in Mysłowice. In 1868, Jewish community from Katowice bought 3 morgues of land for the price of 480 thalers from Polish countryman Jozef Ludnowski. They intended to build there a cemetery.
A territory for a cemetery was on the West from the road to Mikołów (German: Nikolai) and was separated from the town by a railway line leading to Mysłowice. A fact of choosing this area is interesting, because people thought that the town would not be developing in that direction. It was thought that the railway line was its final border, which would force the town expansionin the North and North-East direction, that is the region where Catholic and Evangelical churches, steelworks and mines were built .
A ceremony of the cemetery consecration took place on 9 September 1868 with the participation of a rabbi dr. Rosenthal from Bytom.The first burrial on the new cemetery was on 20 October 1869, when there was a funeral of a four-year-old boy – Carl Münzer. The first funeral of the adult person was on 2 February 1870. That was a funeral of a material administrator Meyer Katz.
In 1868, a splendid mortuary was build near the cemetery. There were Chawra Kadisza rooms and a mournig room. The building was thoroughly rebuilded and expanded in 1870.
The Krebs family was responsible for keeping the cemetery in good condition. They also led the graves records .A lot of funerals took place with a participation of the Great Synagogue choir.
In 1870, on the cemetery, the asphalted pavement of the alleys was built. In 1927, and also after the end of the World War II, the cemetery was expanded to finally reach the size of 1,1 ha.
During the World War II, Nazis partially devastated the cemetery.
Nowadays, on the separated with the wall cemetery, on the surface of 1,1 ha, about 1 400 – 1 500 graves are preserved. There are, among others, splendid graves of three generations of the eminent Jewish families of merit for Katowice development: Goldsteins, Schalsches, Grünfelds, Glasers, Sklareks czy Panofskis and a Jacob Cohn&apos;s grave – the rabbi of Katowice municipality. Some graves are sumptuously decorated. Some of them have the architectonic form which refers to Roman buildings.
Inside the cemetery part, built in 20th century, a monument was exhibited, which commemorates the Jewish victims of the Holocaust 
In the recent years, the cemetery is being renovated. It is opened from 10 a.m to 5 p.m. (on Fridays to 3 p.m.). The cemetery is closed on Sabbath and Jewish holidays.
If the lich gate is closed, its key is in the secretariat of Majs&apos; company – Kozielska 14 street, the gate near to the cemetery, the entry phone is on the building, the first floor (telephone number:32 251 10 22).
The Or-Chaim Foundation takes care of the cemetery. Its president is Jarosław Banyś. Since June 2009, the cemetery territory is monitored by nine cameras, supported by the system reacting for the reflector movement.  The picture from the cameras gets directly to the Or-Chaim Foundation residence and to the Center of the Rescue Notification, which in need can send imediately a patrol of the municipal police or the police.
In autumn 2009, Or-Chaim Foundation finished the main stage of renovation and reparation of the building, which until war was the residence of the funeral association. These works included: changing a roof, plasters, ceiling and floors, protecting the building against cold, doing horizontal and vertical insulation, changing windows and doors. From autumn 2010, renovated former tachara room will function as a specialist Jewish library of the Or-Chaim Foundation, and in the adjacent building there will be a specialist stone workshop. There are plans to lead educational classes in that building. The funeral room will keep its functional purpose.
In 2010 the Or-Chaim Foundation will lead project works to reconstruct the oldest mortuary from 1869, where the foundation plans to open the Jewish museum which will commemorate the history of the Silesian Jews and Jewish rites. It will be a multimedial center with cultural and educational functions.

The Wilson Shaft Gallery is the largest private gallery in Poland-it&apos;s exhibition,  area is over 2000 m2. The Wilson Shaft is located in Katowice on the border of three districts: Nikiszowiec, Janów and Szopienice. The facilities were initially called &quot;Richtofen&quot; and &quot;Hulda&quot;.
 
In 1935 they were renamed into &quot;Wilson&quot; after the President of the United States of America. After the war the area belonged to the Wieczorek Mine.
 
In 1995 the Wilson Shaft was closed and since 1998 Johann Bros, the president of Pro Invest LLC, and Monika Paca, the presidentof Eko-Art. Silesia Foundation, alongwith a group of enthusiasts, have strated adapting this historic facility for a gallery of modern art. The renovation and restoration was accompanied by social revitalization of the surrounding area.

TODAY
&quot;What industry took away, culture must regain&quot; - this motto describes the main goal of creating a moden art gallery in a former mine shaft. For over 10 years the symbol of hard work, effort and mundaneness has been interwined with culture, beauty and spiritality. The harmony between culture and economy is reinforced by modern company offices hidden between the exhibits. Experiencing both the sacred and the profane strengthens the unique character of the Wilson Shaft.

ART
The gallery has a unique private collection of modern art - paintings, sculptures and installations. One can see here the works of Karol Wieczorek, Andrzej Urbanowicz, Marek Kamiński, Lech Kołodziejczyk, Andrzej Tobis Eco-Industri-Art Group, Erwin Sówka and the Janów Group as well as foreign artists.
 
Apart from presenting their own works, the Wilson Shaft Gallery promotes young, ambitious and courageous artist from all over the world. In order to change the postindustrial image of a &quot;grey&quot; Silesia, a group of people connected to the place searches for modern beauty. The gallery is eager to make its unique area available not only to local artists connected with the region. Frequent exhibitions of more and less famous artists diversify the events calendar of the Wilson Shaft.
 
One of the most important recurring events organized by the Wilson Shaft Gallery and Eko-Art Silesia is the Festival of Art Naif. This cheerful and colorful event gathers in one place the works of naive artists from all over the world. The remarkable undertaking has been breaking stereotypes and barriers and attracting thousands of art lovers for many years.
 
OTHER EVENTS
Apart from art exhibitons, the unique area of the gallery is used for concerts, festivals, balls, performances, lectures, conferences and shows. The Wilson Shaft has been chosen as a movie, music video , artistic photo shoot, fashion show and various other events location on numerous occasions. The gallery area is also a perfect place for company and private parties.The sombined postindustrial interor and art exhibits create a memorable atmospher wich makes parties an unforgettable experience for invited guests.

Nikiszowiec (German: Nikischschacht) a part of an administrative district Janów-Nikiszowiec of Katowice city.
Initially it was coal miners&apos; settlement of Giesche mine built on the land of Gieschewald manor (Giszowiec) between 1908–1918 on the mining – metallurgical concern initiative Georg von Giesches Erben.[1] On 9 May 1924, the manor was liquidated, and Nikiszowiec together with Giszowiec were incorporated into Janów district.
In 1951 the district became a part of a new city – Szopienice, however, this decision was voided in 1960, when both Szopienice and Nikiszowiec were incorporated to Katowice.
The remnants of the original workers&apos; housing estate familoks (specialized multi-family residences) comprise one of Poland&apos;s official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated January 28, 2011 and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland.</string>

The main museum building is located in a historic tenement house from 1908. It is a symbol of times of the most dynamic city development and it reflects the residents&apos; wealth. Inside, there is available a permanent exhibition relating to the times of the house origin. It displays the interiors of two types of flats: the bigger one (310 m2), rented by the richest middle class representatives in Katowice and the smaller one (150 m2) intended for moderately rich people. Original furniture and equipment as well as reconstructed interior decorations from that time enable visitors to discover the interesting times of the early 20th century.
In the tenement house there is also the main permanent exposition on Katowice from the 13th century to the present day. Owing to the artefacts and numerous multimedia materials one can trace the history of Katowice – from a small rural settlement up to the capital of the voivodeship and the leading city of the Upper Silesian conurbation.  
In front of the museum building there is situated the life-size statue of the eminent artist Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz. It is worth emphasizing that the Museum of Katowice History is in possession of the largest world collections of his pastel drawings, displayed within temporary exhibitions.

Bringing some heat to the street and some spice to Kato-vice, this hot spot is turning heads and filling stomachs. Started by a couple of travellers with the simple idea of offering a selection of curries from all over the world served up quick and sold for cheap. The results are utterly delicious and borderline revolutionary for the city’s budding ethnic restaurant scene. With a limited but diverse menu, you’ll find something new just for you. The design is cosy yet cool and the service is quick so even if you’re in a hurry you can make time for their curry. Top marks all around.</string>

Delicious pasta and very good pizza. While in Len Arte try the specialty of the day, namely: pasta. It is really yummy. When it comes to pizzas they look fantastic, have very thin dough, good quality ingredients and are big. Polite and efficient service. The staff in Len Arte consists of very young and friendly people. They are willing to give advice and welcome diners with a smile. Restaurant is not huge which helps with saving it Italian climate. Prices are reasonable for ingredients used and way of serving. If your looking for a place to eat real pizza you should be heading directly to Len Arte.</string>

We often judge a city&apos;s merits on whether or not it has a proper vegetarian restaurant, and in this regard Katowice scores some much-needed points. The cheekily named &apos;Golden Ass&apos; features laid back music, bright psychedlic wall patterns and tablecloths, and fertile murals wherein zodiac characters, Buddha and Grecian urns are able to coexist as peacably as the aging hippies, young activists, punk rockers, and school teachers that make up the clientele. The budget food shows a lot more creative flair than the rest of the local cuisine, and here you can pick up flyers for local events.</string>

			<string>Katowice’s nightlife is improving steadily, with more and more bars and clubs opening that hold themselves to a higher creative standard. While there was a time when a Saturday night on the town felt like creeping quietly through a cemetery, that has all changed in a hurry with the emergence of ul. Mariacka as the city’s nightlife headquarters.
A pedestrianised three-block stretch that was once all strip clubs and shady gay saunas (ok, those are still there), the city has put a lot of energy into cleaning it up and turning it into the high street it should be. Despite some dreadful urban design decisions including ugly, uncomfortable benches and strange sculptures, the city is finally seeing results with a plethora of restaurants, cafes, cocktail bars and clubs moving in to give the city centre some buzz. In summer, Mariacka is full of outdoor seating and flooded with people, but there are plenty of other hedonist hideouts to discover elsewhere with the help of this guide. The opening hours we list are flexible; basically if people are drinking, the barman is pouring.

A stylish English pub with smart wood furnishings, classic black and whites and plenty of green, Spencer is an ideal place to loosen the tie after a grueling week of powerpoint presentations, whiteboard marker fumes and breathmints. Making the decision easier is the amiable English-speaking staff, solid line of pub grub like steaks and fish and chips, one of the best selections of whiskey in town, and the black gold commonly referred to as Guinness on draught. Weekends see live bands entertaining a full house, so get there early to get a seat.

There’s a new king in town and just months after lowering his drawbridge he already has legions of loyal subjects crashing his castle nightly. Rajzefiber has truly achieved a rare and almost impossible feat by successfully filling a huge gap in Katowice’s nightlife with serious style and enviable ease. No other club in town has thought to offer an ambitious lineup of great live music AND hot DJs plus offer a menu of quick bar food and rocking cocktails. Upon entering the recently expanded second floor club we had the feeling we’d been coming here for years. The place was totally packed and already jumping at 19:00 on a Saturday. When we came back at 23:00 there was a line 30 people deep waiting to get in! There’s a rising fever for Rajzefiber.

			<string>An extremely well developed system of trams and buses operated by the wonderfully named KZK GOP provide a simple and fast way of getting around Katowice and its surrounding towns. The tickets for the network are valid for both buses and trams. A three-zone system is used, of which Katowice is in zone-one and Chorzów in zone-two. Accordingly, a one-zone ticket is required for the former and a two-zone ticket for travelling between the two. A one-zone ticket costs 3.20zł and now also serves as a 15min ticket allowing you to swap forms of transport (bus to tram and onto a different tram for instance) within that time period. A two-zone ticket costs 3.80zł and also serves as a 30min ticket. There is also a three-zone/one-hour ticket available for 4.80zł. A 18zł 24hr ticket allows travel within all three zones, though it&apos;s hard to imagine  getting your money&apos;s worth out of this without spending the whole day on the tram. Okay, we admit, there&apos;s not much reason to get off.
Almost all travel within Katowice and Chorzów can be accomplished using trams, most of which run through the new stops on the Rynek. Tram numbers 6, 11 and 19 run between the Rynek and Chorzów via Silesia Park and are the most useful tram for getting there and back. Tickets can be bought from any kiosk, or from bright yellow machines found at many tram stops around the city. Make sure you validate your ticket when entering the tram or bus. The penalty for riding without a validated ticket is 90zł (plus the price of the ticket) on the spot. (The normal price of the fine if you pay within 7 days is 125zł plus the price of the ticket.)

			<string>Silesian Interurbans, one of the largest tram (streetcar) systems in the world, has been in existence since 1894.

Katowice railway station is a railway station in Katowice, Silesia, Poland, and the largest railway station in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region. Domestic and international trains connect at the station to most major cities in Europe and are operated primarily by Polskie Koleje Państwowe.
The station replaced the 19th century Katowice historic train station. Opened in 1972, the new station was an example of modern architecture and the main railway hall was designed by Polish architects Wacław Kłyszewski, Jerzy Mokrzyński and Eugeniusz Wierzbicki, with construction supervised by Wacław Zalewski. The hall&apos;s design took into account the unusual ground conditions of this former coal mining region, which is still susceptible to tectonic movement.
The Polish government in July 2009 signed a construction agreement with the Spanish firm Neinver for the building of a new integrated transportation/commercial center in Katowice. The investment involved the reconstruction of the railway station, the construction of an underground bus station, a shopping center (Galeria Katowicka), [2] an office tower, and the reconfiguring of streets, sidewalks and public space around the station. The overall investment is estimated at about 240 million euros.
The new project broke ground in May 2010 and by the end of September 2010 a temporary train station was open for passenger service. The old concourse closed on 1 October 2010 and gradually a number of platforms were also shut, with staggered platform repair being carried out in stages. Demolition of the main hall lasted from 22 December 2010 to 11 January 2011. The entire complex (including the adjoining Galeria Katowicka mall on Szewczyk Square) was completed by the summer of 2013, with the new main hall and its integrated (underground) bus station in operation by late 2012. The new station is connected to a large shopping mall.</string>
			<string>Pyrzowice airport KTW
Location: Wolności 90, 42-625 Ożarowice, Poland
48 32 392 72 00

Katowice International Airport (Polish: Międzynarodowy Port Lotniczy Katowice) (IATA: KTW, ICAO: EPKT) is an international airport, located in Pyrzowice, 30 km (19 mi) north of center of Katowice, Poland. The airport has the fourth biggest passenger flow in Poland.

The place where the Katowice International Airport is now located, was first used by German soldiers. In 1940 the Luftwaffe began construction of an airbase in the meadows around Pyrzowice. The Germans built three stone and concrete strips with a length of runway from 1000 to 1500 meters and 50 meters wide. The airbase was used for the handling of military aircraft, flying from the inner part of the German Reich to the aeroplanes taking supplies to troops on the Eastern Front. In the final phase of World War II, the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet powered aircraft missile systems have been tested here. After the death of Luftwaffe flying ace gen. Ernst Udet in 1941, the airfield was named Udetfeld.
From 1945 to 1951, Soviet Army&apos;s soldiers were stationed at the airbase. In the early 1950s, the Soviets handed the airbase to the Polish Air Force. It was then used by the 39 Fighter Regiment, created on 17 April 1951.
The airbase Pyrzowice was for the first time made available for passenger traffic on 6 October 1966, when the first plane of LOT Polish Airlines, taking off for Warsaw. By the end of 1969 year a small passenger terminal was built (550 m²) with a taxiway and apron front of the airport.
On 28 May 2015 a new runway with a length of 3 200 m was opened.

By car
In 2006 express road S1 was opened between the Podwarpie junction and the airport. Thanks to this road the airport is easily accessible from Katowice and other cities of the region by national road 86 and from Kraków by A4 motorway or national road 94. The airport is also accessible by national road 78 and A1 motorway
By bus
There is an hourly bus service between Katowice city centre and the airport. The bus leaves every full hour from Katowice Main Railway Station and stops near Altus Building, Novotel Katowice and in Sosnowiec (Milowice Shopping Center).[10] It takes approximately 50 minutes to get from center of Katowice to the airport. Bus connections from other largest cities of the region, such as Kraków (about 75 minutes travel),[11] Częstochowa[12] and minibus - inter alia from/to Opole,[13][14] Wrocław[13][14] are also available. Local buses connect to the city of Bytom where one can change for bus to Katowice.

		<string>Narodowa Orkiestra Symfoniczna Polskiego Radia z siedzibą w Katowicach (NOSPR), is one of Poland&apos;s premier musical institutions. It was founded in 1935 in Warsaw. PNRSO is the formally incorrect English short name of the Orchestra, also Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra is incorrect. National Polish Radio Symphonic Orchestra in Katowice (with seat in Katowice) is adequate (NPRSO) but better only Polish NOSPR.History[edit]
The symphonic orchestra was created in 1935 and led by Grzegorz Fitelberg until the outbreak of World War II. In March 1945 Witold Rowicki revived the orchestra in Katowice. In 1947, Grzegorz Fitelberg, upon his return from abroad, took over the post of the Artistic Director. After his death in 1953, the orchestra was headed in succession by Jan Krenz, Bohdan Wodiczko, Kazimierz Kord, Tadeusz Strugała, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Stanisław Wisłocki, Jacek Kaspszyk, Antoni Wit, Gabriel Chmura and, once again, Jacek Kaspszyk. In September 2000, Joanna Wnuk-Nazarowa was appointed the General and Programme Director. In January 2009 Michał Klauza became the Associate Conductor. Stanisław Skrowaczewski holds the title of the first Guest Conductor of the PNRSO, Jan Krenz is a Honorary Director and the function of Artistic Advisor was fulfilled by Jerzy Semkow. At the beginning of the season 2012/2013, Alexander Liebreich became the Artistic Director and Chief Conductor of the NOSPR.

Recordings[edit]
The orchestra has recorded more than 198 compact discs for many Polish and foreign labels (Decca, EMI, Philips, etc.) and made numerous archival recordings for the needs of Polish Radio. For the Naxos label they recorded among others complete works of Witold Lutosławski (9 CDs), all symphonies of Tchaikowsky, Schumann, most of Penderecki&apos;s (I-V), Mahler&apos;s (except for VIII), as well as works of Kilar, Wieniawski, Moszkowski and Górecki and for Chandos Records they made a three record album with music of Mieczysław Weinberg. Recorded by PNRSO K. Penderecki&apos;s Credo, H.M. Górecki&apos;s Symphony No. 3 and W. Kilar&apos;s Missa pro pace were released on DVD and SACD by Polish Radio as The Sacred Triptych. For phonographic achievements the orchestra was honoured with numerous prizes among others Five Piano Concertos by Prokofiev under direction of Antoni Wit with the soloist Kun Woo Paik were awarded the Diapason d&apos;Or and the Grand Prix du Disque de la Nouvelle Académie du Disque 1992 and the recording of Turangalila Symphony by Olivier Messiaen under Antoni Wit was awarded the 2002 Cannes Classical Award. Recently a record for DUX with works of Krzysztof Penderecki (Capriccio for violin and orchestra, De natura sonoris no. 2 for the piano and orchestra Resurrection) with participation of NOSPR as well as soloists Beata Bilińska and Patrycja Piekutowska conducted by the composer received prestigious MIDEM Classical Award 2008 in the category of Contemporary Music.</string>

Januar 1929 gegründet. Anfangs wurden die Exponate im Gebäude des Schlesischen Parlamentes ausgestellt, gleichzeitig wurde jedoch 1936 mit der Errichtung des modernen, repräsentativen Neubaus, nach dem Projekt des Architekten Karol Schayer, für das Museum begonnen. Die Eröffnung war auf Frühjahr 1940 vorgesehen. Nach dem Vorschlag des Direktors des Landesmuseums Beuthen, Franz Pfützenreiter (1888–1968) wurde das fast fertige Gebäude „als Denkmal des polnisch-jüdischen Hochmuts“ 1941–1944 abgebrochen. Es blieb nur der Wohnflügel übrig. Die heilgebliebenen Exponate wurden teilweise geraubt und zum Teil nach Beuthen (Bytom), in das dort ansässige Oberschlesische Landesmuseum geschafft worden. Es wurde auch die Große Synagoge an der ul. Mickiewicza (Mickiewicz-Str.) und das jüdische Viertel der Stadt in Brand gesetzt. Nach dem Krieg gab es weder die nötigen finanziellen Mittel noch den guten Willen der kommunistischen Zentralregierung das Museum, das die Autonomiebestrebungen Schlesiens verkörperte wiederherzurichten. An seiner Stelle errichtete man ein Gewerkschaftsgebäude. Erst 1984 gab man dem Bevölkerungsdruck nach und gründete das Schlesische Museum neu, größtenteils mit neuen Exponaten. Allerdings baute man nicht das Gebäude Schayers wieder auf, sondern quartierte das Museum vorläufig in ein Neurenaissancegebäude, das ehemalige Grand Hotel Wiener, an der al. Korfantego 3, das zu dieser Zeit gar nicht für ein Museum geeignet und z.T. renovierungsbedürftig war. Man hat klein, mit nur einem Ausstellungszimmer angefangen, und führte gleichzeitig die nötigen Arbeiten am Gebäude durch, die erst 1992, nach der politischen Wende, beendet wurden. Zu den heutigen Sammlungen des Museums zählen über 75.000, vor allem ethnologische und archäologische Exponate, die mit der Stadt und Region Oberschlesien zusammenhängen und eine Gemäldegalerie der polnischen Malerei des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts, die 233 Kunstwerke umfasst. Darüber hinaus werden im Museum verschiedene Sonderausstellungen gezeigt, die thematisch auch andere Regionen betreffen können.

Seit Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts wurden öffentlich Pläne diskutiert, das Museum in ein neues, größeres Gebäude umzusiedeln. Der geplante neue Standort ist das Gelände der ehemaligen „Zeche Katowice“. Am 15. Juni 2007 wurde der Architektenwettbewerb für den Neubau des Museums entschieden. Einstimmig wurde das Projekt der Architekten Riegler Riewe aus Graz, Österreich zum Sieger erklärt. Der Bau begann 2011 und wurde 2014 abgeschlossen.[1] Die Gesamtkosten sollen sich auf 324 Mio. Złoty belaufen. Das neue Museumsgebäude umfasst sieben Stockwerke, davon drei unterirdische. Es wurden die Einrichtungen des stillgelegten Bergwerkes integriert.</string>

		<string>International Conference Center in Katowice is an exceptional place on the business event venue map in Poland. Opened in 2015, it stands out for its post-industrial aesthetics and functional design, serving as a venue for conferences, congresses, exhibitions, trade fairs and shows. Able to accommodate 15 000 visitors, alongside the nearby Spodek Arena, it is one of the largest venues for conferences, exhibitions, and sports and entertainment events in Poland. Designed by JEMS Architekci, the International Congress Centre in Katowice won the SARP award of the year for the best architectural object built on the territory of Poland in 2015.

The Polish Architects’ Association selected the International Congress Centre in Katowice and the Katyń Museum in Warsaw as the best architectural projects realized in Poland in 2015.

Designed by JEMS Architekci, the International Congress Centre in Katowice won the SARP award of the year for the best architectural object built on the territory of Poland in 2015.

The recognition for the best Polish architectural object built with public funds, on the other hand, went to the Katyń Museum in Warsaw, the work of BBGK Architekci. The International Congress Centre in Katowice won the 2015 Building of the Year Poll. In the contest organized by the architectural website bryla.pl, the building received the most votes from internet users, won a jury prize (third place), and a distinction from the sponsor. The international Congress Centre in Katowice defeated ten other projects nominated in the ninth edition of the Building of the Year poll that rewards the best Polish buildings. In 2015, its rivals included, to name but a few, the Jordanki Cultural and Congress Centre, Olsztyn-Mazury airport in Toruń, the revitalized mill in Szamotuły, the European Centre for Geological Education in Chęciny and the reconstructed seat of the Foksal Gallery in Warsaw.

The International Congress Centre in Katowice was designed by the JEMS Architekci studio. It is an exceptional object on the map of business event venues in Poland. Handed over to public use in 2015, it stands out for its post-industrial aesthetics, useful design and multi-functional purpose, serving as a venue for congresses, conferences, exhibitions, trade shows and performances. The characteristic green-roof building is designed to host 15,000 people and, together with the neighbouring architectural icon, the Spodek Sports and Entertainment Arena, provides one of the largest venues for congress and exhibition meetings in Poland.

The Building of the Year contest has been organized since 2007. Buildings selected by internet users in recent years include, for instance, the Mieczysław Karłowicz Philharmonic Hall in Szczecin, the Scientific Information Centre and Academic Library in Katowice (2011), the Old Brewery in Poznań, the Polish Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo, and the EC1 power plant in Łódź.</string>

		<string>Spodek (meaning &quot;saucer&quot; in Polish) is a multipurpose arena complex in Katowice, Poland, opened in 1971 at ul. Korfantego 35 under the name Wojewódzka Hala Widowiskowo-Sportowa w Katowicach (Voivodeship Sport and Show Arena in Katowice), under which it is known in the Polish technical/architectural literature, and under which it formally functioned until 1997.

Aside from the main dome, the complex includes a gym, an ice rink, a hotel and three large car parks. It was the largest indoor venue of its kind in Poland until it was surpassed by Kraków Arena in 2014. It hosts many important cultural and business events. Music concerts are especially common non-sport events. Spodek can hold 11,500 people, although this number is in practice limited to 10,000 or even 8,000 due to stage set-ups obscuring the view. Its Polish name refers to a flying saucer (its shape resembles a UFO). Spodek is a major contribution to the cultural significance of Katowice in Poland, especially for the younger generations. It has also been used as an unofficial logo for the city on posters promoting redevelopment in Katowice. Spodek is home to HC GKS Katowice ice hockey club in the winter months.</string>
		<string>Narodowa Orkiestra Symfoniczna Polskiego Radia z siedzibą w Katowicach (NOSPR), is one of Poland&apos;s premier musical institutions. It was founded in 1935 in Warsaw. PNRSO is the formally incorrect English short name of the Orchestra, also Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra is incorrect. National Polish Radio Symphonic Orchestra in Katowice (with seat in Katowice) is adequate (NPRSO) but better only Polish NOSPR.History[edit]
The symphonic orchestra was created in 1935 and led by Grzegorz Fitelberg until the outbreak of World War II. In March 1945 Witold Rowicki revived the orchestra in Katowice. In 1947, Grzegorz Fitelberg, upon his return from abroad, took over the post of the Artistic Director. After his death in 1953, the orchestra was headed in succession by Jan Krenz, Bohdan Wodiczko, Kazimierz Kord, Tadeusz Strugała, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Stanisław Wisłocki, Jacek Kaspszyk, Antoni Wit, Gabriel Chmura and, once again, Jacek Kaspszyk. In September 2000, Joanna Wnuk-Nazarowa was appointed the General and Programme Director. In January 2009 Michał Klauza became the Associate Conductor. Stanisław Skrowaczewski holds the title of the first Guest Conductor of the PNRSO, Jan Krenz is a Honorary Director and the function of Artistic Advisor was fulfilled by Jerzy Semkow. At the beginning of the season 2012/2013, Alexander Liebreich became the Artistic Director and Chief Conductor of the NOSPR.

Recordings[edit]
The orchestra has recorded more than 198 compact discs for many Polish and foreign labels (Decca, EMI, Philips, etc.) and made numerous archival recordings for the needs of Polish Radio. For the Naxos label they recorded among others complete works of Witold Lutosławski (9 CDs), all symphonies of Tchaikowsky, Schumann, most of Penderecki&apos;s (I-V), Mahler&apos;s (except for VIII), as well as works of Kilar, Wieniawski, Moszkowski and Górecki and for Chandos Records they made a three record album with music of Mieczysław Weinberg. Recorded by PNRSO K. Penderecki&apos;s Credo, H.M. Górecki&apos;s Symphony No. 3 and W. Kilar&apos;s Missa pro pace were released on DVD and SACD by Polish Radio as The Sacred Triptych. For phonographic achievements the orchestra was honoured with numerous prizes among others Five Piano Concertos by Prokofiev under direction of Antoni Wit with the soloist Kun Woo Paik were awarded the Diapason d&apos;Or and the Grand Prix du Disque de la Nouvelle Académie du Disque 1992 and the recording of Turangalila Symphony by Olivier Messiaen under Antoni Wit was awarded the 2002 Cannes Classical Award. Recently a record for DUX with works of Krzysztof Penderecki (Capriccio for violin and orchestra, De natura sonoris no. 2 for the piano and orchestra Resurrection) with participation of NOSPR as well as soloists Beata Bilińska and Patrycja Piekutowska conducted by the composer received prestigious MIDEM Classical Award 2008 in the category of Contemporary Music.</string>
