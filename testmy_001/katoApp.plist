Spodek (meaning &quot;saucer&quot; in Polish) is a multipurpose arena complex in Katowice, Poland, opened in 1971 at ul. Korfantego 35 under the name Wojewódzka Hala Widowiskowo-Sportowa w Katowicach (Voivodeship Sport and Show Arena in Katowice), under which it is known in the Polish technical/architectural literature, and under which it formally functioned until 1997.

Aside from the main dome, the complex includes a gym, an ice rink, a hotel and three large car parks. It was the largest indoor venue of its kind in Poland until it was surpassed by Kraków Arena in 2014. It hosts many important cultural and business events. Music concerts are especially common non-sport events. Spodek can hold 11,500 people, although this number is in practice limited to 10,000 or even 8,000 due to stage set-ups obscuring the view. Its Polish name refers to a flying saucer (its shape resembles a UFO). Spodek is a major contribution to the cultural significance of Katowice in Poland, especially for the younger generations. It has also been used as an unofficial logo for the city on posters promoting redevelopment in Katowice. Spodek is home to HC GKS Katowice ice hockey club in the winter months.</string>

The centre of Katowice with 20 hectares of post-mining emptiness undergoes a revitalisation on an unprecedented scale in Poland. The objective is to point the city towards culture. The buildings there are supralocal and stimulate the entire region.

The NOSPR Project was selected in an international competition. We chose a building with a simple, compact outline in the south of the 4 acre plot to keep the project close to the centre. Designing public spaces, we filled two squares and a park with 450 trees and attractions such as fountains, musical toys, a maze and an amphitheatre. The key idea was to contain a story within a story; combining to give the whole picture. Multi-layered, sensual space expressed through structure, materials, textures, light and sound which invokes emotions creating a unique atmosphere for meetings between musicians and music lovers.

The first layer is a brick monolith: cut by entrances and windows. We used a local material – rough, brown outside, glassy red in niches – in line with local building tradition. Modernising the traditional method of burning, we reached the desired quality and durability. We provided undisturbed acoustics by hiding noisy infrastructure within 80 external brick chimneys.

We closed the rich, functional program within a simple, logical structure: the outer ring for musicians, the atrium for music lovers and inside – the hall for music – three separated, yet interdependent zones. The orchestra’s workplace is a four-storey frame with more than 400 rooms including a chamber hall, rehearsal rooms, dressing rooms, recording studios, a canteen and small hotel.

The atrium is a multi-functional public space, as a street in a city creates background for life inside, features a variety of materials, textures, colours and forms combining the interior with the exterior. The heart of the establishment is the 1800-seat great concert hall. Its majestic presence is noticeable in every part of the building as musicians and music lovers can easily circumnavigate it. Anthracite outside, the concrete block stamped by wooden formworks is reminiscent of the old wood yard and coal mined here a decade ago. The inside is like an instrument, a play of soft shapes on the ceiling, walls and balconies with the hardness of concrete and birch plywood subordinated to the two most important aspects: acoustics and atmosphere.

The authors’s technological solutions such as the spherical reinforced-concrete construction, dyed-in-the-mass shell of the hall, rubber wavy relief shuttering, plywood-formed details such as railings and seats give character.

The six-year project involved meetings with local artisans, builders, officials, investors, users, architects, specialists, world-renowned acousticians and prominent artists; all this to fill this place with people and music.

Other important sustainable aspects of the work: revitalisation of central post-industrial land, demand for high-quality public space, minimised costs, compact shape, sustainable energy-saving technologies (100% LED), reference to Silesian tradition and landscape, use of local and natural materials, social activation – access to culture, new jobs, appropriateness of investment – a national institution.[Tomasz Konior]</string>

			<string>Location: Main Square
Until recently, one could easily be forgiven for standing in the middle of the market square and trying to find the market square. The massive construction works are finally finished and the snazzy new Rynek 2.0 complete with a flowing river, deck chairs and palm trees is open for business just in time for the summer festival season. Before the massive overhaul (and we mean massive!), Katowice&apos;s &apos;Rynek&apos; was basically a large traffic roundabout and tram stop surrounded by a faded collection of mismatched buildings in architectural styles that had mostly fallen out of favour, if they ever engendered any enthusiasm to begin with. For years the city has known that turning its market square into, you know, an actual market square, would be a crucial step toward becoming a respectable Polish city. A plan to modernise and pedestrianise the Rynek was put in place as far back as 2008. The first step was modernising the Soviet-era monstrosity at ul. Młyńska that uglied up an entire block of the Rynek and they elegantly transformed it into the new modern City Hall. All work has now been completed including the re-routing of the entire Silesian tram network through the &apos;new&apos; Rynek (check new tram schedule here rozklady.kzkgop.pl - there is an English version).</string>
			<string>Location: Park Kosciuszki
The Kosciuszko Park, which has existed since 1925, is one of the most famous and frequented parks in Katowice, Poland. It is situated at the street of the same name.
Its foundation dates back to 1888 when a municipal park was founded on the 6 ha area of suburban grove. The present area of the park is 72 ha. Its arrangement is influenced by English gardens-parks, which is emphasized by an alley of roses turned to wild. The park used to belong to the most beautiful places in Katowice, also because of the flower arrangements on the flower-beds and pergolas and classicistic gardens. After dusk the park is lit by stylish street lamps but it is not a safe part of the town in the evening.
In the park there are several structures which are worth seeing. There is a commemorative plaque funded for the patron, Tadeusz Kościuszko, by the people of Katowice in 1925. The parachute tower also dates back to that time. It is currently being rebuilt to its height of 40 m; it was erected as a training structure. Not far from it there is a monument commemorating the heroic participation of scouts in the defence of the town against the Nazi invaders in 1939. Two unique structures of wooden building in Upper Silesia, a manorial granary from 1688 (burnt in 1970) and the Church of St. Michael Archangel, a wooden church under the invocation of St. Michael from 1510 moved from Syrynia, were placed in the park. In the park there is also a permanent gallery of plein-air sculpture, collecting works of famous artists of the region: Zygmunt Brachmanski, Augustyn Dyrda, Joachim Krakowczyk, Piotr Latoska, Jacek Sarapata, Andrzej Szczepaniec.
In winter children can use a toboggan track and a ski route. The Soviet soldiers who died in 1945 are also buried there. The Park Hall, erected in the 1950s, is situated opposite the park and holds 3.500 people. In the past it used to be a place of many interesting cultural performances. At present it is a grocery/supermarket. Nearby there is a military cemetery from the interbellum. At no great distance towards the centre there is a sports stadium of the Physical Training Academy.</string>

			<string>KZK GOP

An extremely well developed system of trams and buses operated by the wonderfully named KZK GOP provide a simple and fast way of getting around Katowice and its surrounding towns. The tickets for the network are valid for both buses and trams. A three-zone system is used, of which Katowice is in zone-one and Chorzów in zone-two. Accordingly, a one-zone ticket is required for the former and a two-zone ticket for travelling between the two. A one-zone ticket costs 3.20zł and now also serves as a 15min ticket allowing you to swap forms of transport (bus to tram and onto a different tram for instance) within that time period. A two-zone ticket costs 3.80zł and also serves as a 30min ticket. There is also a three-zone/one-hour ticket available for 4.80zł. A 18zł 24hr ticket allows travel within all three zones, though it&apos;s hard to imagine getting your money&apos;s worth out of this without spending the whole day on the tram. Okay, we admit, there&apos;s not much reason to get off.

Almost all travel within Katowice and Chorzów can be accomplished using trams, most of which run through the new stops on the Rynek. Tram numbers 6, 11 and 19 run between the Rynek and Chorzów via Silesia Park and are the most useful tram for getting there and back. Tickets can be bought from any kiosk, or from bright yellow machines found at many tram stops around the city. Make sure you validate your ticket when entering the tram or bus. The penalty for riding without a validated ticket is 90zł (plus the price of the ticket) on the spot. (The normal price of the fine if you pay within 7 days is 125zł plus the price of the ticket.)

			<string>Silesian Interurbans, one of the largest tram (streetcar) systems in the world, has been in existence since 1894. The system is spread over more than 50 kilometres (east-west axis) and covers thirteen towns in the Upper Silesia metropolitan area (Southern Poland) and their suburbs (Katowice, the capital town of the region, Będzin, Bytom, Chorzów, Czeladź, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Gliwice, Mysłowice, Ruda Śląska, Siemianowice Śląskie, Sosnowiec, Świętochłowice, and Zabrze, until 2006 also in Piekary Śląskie and Wojkowice), which is densely industrialised (coal, coke, steel and other industries; though decreasing since the 1990s) and inhabited by more than 2 million people.

			<string>Katowice railway station is a railway station in Katowice, Silesia, Poland, and the largest railway station in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region. Domestic and international trains connect at the station to most major cities in Europe and are operated primarily by Polskie Koleje Państwowe.
The station replaced the 19th century Katowice historic train station. Opened in 1972, the new station was an example of modern architecture and the main railway hall was designed by Polish architects Wacław Kłyszewski, Jerzy Mokrzyński and Eugeniusz Wierzbicki, with construction supervised by Wacław Zalewski. The hall&apos;s design took into account the unusual ground conditions of this former coal mining region, which is still susceptible to tectonic movement.
The Polish government in July 2009 signed a construction agreement with the Spanish firm Neinver for the building of a new integrated transportation/commercial center in Katowice. The investment involved the reconstruction of the railway station, the construction of an underground bus station, a shopping center (Galeria Katowicka), [2] an office tower, and the reconfiguring of streets, sidewalks and public space around the station. The overall investment is estimated at about 240 million euros.
The new project broke ground in May 2010 and by the end of September 2010 a temporary train station was open for passenger service. The old concourse closed on 1 October 2010 and gradually a number of platforms were also shut, with staggered platform repair being carried out in stages. Demolition of the main hall lasted from 22 December 2010 to 11 January 2011. The entire complex (including the adjoining Galeria Katowicka mall on Szewczyk Square) was completed by the summer of 2013, with the new main hall and its integrated (underground) bus station in operation by late 2012. The new station is connected to a large shopping mall.

		<string>Narodowa Orkiestra Symfoniczna Polskiego Radia z siedzibą w Katowicach (NOSPR), is one of Poland&apos;s premier musical institutions. It was founded in 1935 in Warsaw. PNRSO is the formally incorrect English short name of the Orchestra, also Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra is incorrect. National Polish Radio Symphonic Orchestra in Katowice (with seat in Katowice) is adequate (NPRSO) but better only Polish NOSPR.History[edit]
The symphonic orchestra was created in 1935 and led by Grzegorz Fitelberg until the outbreak of World War II. In March 1945 Witold Rowicki revived the orchestra in Katowice. In 1947, Grzegorz Fitelberg, upon his return from abroad, took over the post of the Artistic Director. After his death in 1953, the orchestra was headed in succession by Jan Krenz, Bohdan Wodiczko, Kazimierz Kord, Tadeusz Strugała, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Stanisław Wisłocki, Jacek Kaspszyk, Antoni Wit, Gabriel Chmura and, once again, Jacek Kaspszyk. In September 2000, Joanna Wnuk-Nazarowa was appointed the General and Programme Director. In January 2009 Michał Klauza became the Associate Conductor. Stanisław Skrowaczewski holds the title of the first Guest Conductor of the PNRSO, Jan Krenz is a Honorary Director and the function of Artistic Advisor was fulfilled by Jerzy Semkow. At the beginning of the season 2012/2013, Alexander Liebreich became the Artistic Director and Chief Conductor of the NOSPR.

Recordings[edit]
The orchestra has recorded more than 198 compact discs for many Polish and foreign labels (Decca, EMI, Philips, etc.) and made numerous archival recordings for the needs of Polish Radio. For the Naxos label they recorded among others complete works of Witold Lutosławski (9 CDs), all symphonies of Tchaikowsky, Schumann, most of Penderecki&apos;s (I-V), Mahler&apos;s (except for VIII), as well as works of Kilar, Wieniawski, Moszkowski and Górecki and for Chandos Records they made a three record album with music of Mieczysław Weinberg. Recorded by PNRSO K. Penderecki&apos;s Credo, H.M. Górecki&apos;s Symphony No. 3 and W. Kilar&apos;s Missa pro pace were released on DVD and SACD by Polish Radio as The Sacred Triptych. For phonographic achievements the orchestra was honoured with numerous prizes among others Five Piano Concertos by Prokofiev under direction of Antoni Wit with the soloist Kun Woo Paik were awarded the Diapason d&apos;Or and the Grand Prix du Disque de la Nouvelle Académie du Disque 1992 and the recording of Turangalila Symphony by Olivier Messiaen under Antoni Wit was awarded the 2002 Cannes Classical Award. Recently a record for DUX with works of Krzysztof Penderecki (Capriccio for violin and orchestra, De natura sonoris no. 2 for the piano and orchestra Resurrection) with participation of NOSPR as well as soloists Beata Bilińska and Patrycja Piekutowska conducted by the composer received prestigious MIDEM Classical Award 2008 in the category of Contemporary Music.</string>
		<string>Schlesisches Museum (Muzeum Śląskie) ist das bekannteste Museum der Stadt Katowice. Das Museum wurde kraft des Beschlusses des Schlesischen Parlamentes (Sejm Śląski), am 23. Januar 1929 gegründet. Anfangs wurden die Exponate im Gebäude des Schlesischen Parlamentes ausgestellt, gleichzeitig wurde jedoch 1936 mit der Errichtung des modernen, repräsentativen Neubaus, nach dem Projekt des Architekten Karol Schayer, für das Museum begonnen. Die Eröffnung war auf Frühjahr 1940 vorgesehen. Nach dem Vorschlag des Direktors des Landesmuseums Beuthen, Franz Pfützenreiter (1888–1968) wurde das fast fertige Gebäude „als Denkmal des polnisch-jüdischen Hochmuts“ 1941–1944 abgebrochen. Es blieb nur der Wohnflügel übrig. Die heilgebliebenen Exponate wurden teilweise geraubt und zum Teil nach Beuthen (Bytom), in das dort ansässige Oberschlesische Landesmuseum geschafft worden. Es wurde auch die Große Synagoge an der ul. Mickiewicza (Mickiewicz-Str.) und das jüdische Viertel der Stadt in Brand gesetzt. Nach dem Krieg gab es weder die nötigen finanziellen Mittel noch den guten Willen der kommunistischen Zentralregierung das Museum, das die Autonomiebestrebungen Schlesiens verkörperte wiederherzurichten. An seiner Stelle errichtete man ein Gewerkschaftsgebäude. Erst 1984 gab man dem Bevölkerungsdruck nach und gründete das Schlesische Museum neu, größtenteils mit neuen Exponaten. Allerdings baute man nicht das Gebäude Schayers wieder auf, sondern quartierte das Museum vorläufig in ein Neurenaissancegebäude, das ehemalige Grand Hotel Wiener, an der al. Korfantego 3, das zu dieser Zeit gar nicht für ein Museum geeignet und z.T. renovierungsbedürftig war. Man hat klein, mit nur einem Ausstellungszimmer angefangen, und führte gleichzeitig die nötigen Arbeiten am Gebäude durch, die erst 1992, nach der politischen Wende, beendet wurden. Zu den heutigen Sammlungen des Museums zählen über 75.000, vor allem ethnologische und archäologische Exponate, die mit der Stadt und Region Oberschlesien zusammenhängen und eine Gemäldegalerie der polnischen Malerei des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts, die 233 Kunstwerke umfasst. Darüber hinaus werden im Museum verschiedene Sonderausstellungen gezeigt, die thematisch auch andere Regionen betreffen können.

Seit Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts wurden öffentlich Pläne diskutiert, das Museum in ein neues, größeres Gebäude umzusiedeln. Der geplante neue Standort ist das Gelände der ehemaligen „Zeche Katowice“. Am 15. Juni 2007 wurde der Architektenwettbewerb für den Neubau des Museums entschieden. Einstimmig wurde das Projekt der Architekten Riegler Riewe aus Graz, Österreich zum Sieger erklärt. Der Bau begann 2011 und wurde 2014 abgeschlossen.[1] Die Gesamtkosten sollen sich auf 324 Mio. Złoty belaufen. Das neue Museumsgebäude umfasst sieben Stockwerke, davon drei unterirdische. Es wurden die Einrichtungen des stillgelegten Bergwerkes integriert.</string>

The International Congress Centre in Katowice won the 2015 Building of the Year Poll. In the contest organized by the architectural website bryla.pl, the building received the most votes from internet users, won a jury prize (third place), and a distinction from the sponsor. The international Congress Centre in Katowice defeated ten other projects nominated in the ninth edition of the Building of the Year poll that rewards the best Polish buildings. In 2015, its rivals included, to name but a few, the Jordanki Cultural and Congress Centre, Olsztyn-Mazury airport in Toruń, the revitalized mill in Szamotuły, the European Centre for Geological Education in Chęciny and the reconstructed seat of the Foksal Gallery in Warsaw.

The International Congress Centre in Katowice was designed by the JEMS Architekci studio. It is an exceptional object on the map of business event venues in Poland. Handed over to public use in 2015, it stands out for its post-industrial aesthetics, useful design and multi-functional purpose, serving as a venue for congresses, conferences, exhibitions, trade shows and performances. The characteristic green-roof building is designed to host 15,000 people and, together with the neighbouring architectural icon, the Spodek Sports and Entertainment Arena, provides one of the largest venues for congress and exhibition meetings in Poland.

The Building of the Year contest has been organized since 2007. Buildings selected by internet users in recent years include, for instance, the Mieczysław Karłowicz Philharmonic Hall in Szczecin, the Scientific Information Centre and Academic Library in Katowice (2011), the Old Brewery in Poznań, the Polish Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo, and the EC1 power plant in Łódź.</string>

		<string>Spodek (meaning &quot;saucer&quot; in Polish) is a multipurpose arena complex in Katowice, Poland, opened in 1971 at ul. Korfantego 35 under the name Wojewódzka Hala Widowiskowo-Sportowa w Katowicach (Voivodeship Sport and Show Arena in Katowice), under which it is known in the Polish technical/architectural literature, and under which it formally functioned until 1997.

Aside from the main dome, the complex includes a gym, an ice rink, a hotel and three large car parks. It was the largest indoor venue of its kind in Poland until it was surpassed by Kraków Arena in 2014. It hosts many important cultural and business events. Music concerts are especially common non-sport events. Spodek can hold 11,500 people, although this number is in practice limited to 10,000 or even 8,000 due to stage set-ups obscuring the view. Its Polish name refers to a flying saucer (its shape resembles a UFO). Spodek is a major contribution to the cultural significance of Katowice in Poland, especially for the younger generations. It has also been used as an unofficial logo for the city on posters promoting redevelopment in Katowice. Spodek is home to HC GKS Katowice ice hockey club in the winter months.</string>
		<string>Narodowa Orkiestra Symfoniczna Polskiego Radia z siedzibą w Katowicach (NOSPR), is one of Poland&apos;s premier musical institutions. It was founded in 1935 in Warsaw. PNRSO is the formally incorrect English short name of the Orchestra, also Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra is incorrect. National Polish Radio Symphonic Orchestra in Katowice (with seat in Katowice) is adequate (NPRSO) but better only Polish NOSPR.History[edit]
The symphonic orchestra was created in 1935 and led by Grzegorz Fitelberg until the outbreak of World War II. In March 1945 Witold Rowicki revived the orchestra in Katowice. In 1947, Grzegorz Fitelberg, upon his return from abroad, took over the post of the Artistic Director. After his death in 1953, the orchestra was headed in succession by Jan Krenz, Bohdan Wodiczko, Kazimierz Kord, Tadeusz Strugała, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Stanisław Wisłocki, Jacek Kaspszyk, Antoni Wit, Gabriel Chmura and, once again, Jacek Kaspszyk. In September 2000, Joanna Wnuk-Nazarowa was appointed the General and Programme Director. In January 2009 Michał Klauza became the Associate Conductor. Stanisław Skrowaczewski holds the title of the first Guest Conductor of the PNRSO, Jan Krenz is a Honorary Director and the function of Artistic Advisor was fulfilled by Jerzy Semkow. At the beginning of the season 2012/2013, Alexander Liebreich became the Artistic Director and Chief Conductor of the NOSPR.

Recordings[edit]
The orchestra has recorded more than 198 compact discs for many Polish and foreign labels (Decca, EMI, Philips, etc.) and made numerous archival recordings for the needs of Polish Radio. For the Naxos label they recorded among others complete works of Witold Lutosławski (9 CDs), all symphonies of Tchaikowsky, Schumann, most of Penderecki&apos;s (I-V), Mahler&apos;s (except for VIII), as well as works of Kilar, Wieniawski, Moszkowski and Górecki and for Chandos Records they made a three record album with music of Mieczysław Weinberg. Recorded by PNRSO K. Penderecki&apos;s Credo, H.M. Górecki&apos;s Symphony No. 3 and W. Kilar&apos;s Missa pro pace were released on DVD and SACD by Polish Radio as The Sacred Triptych. For phonographic achievements the orchestra was honoured with numerous prizes among others Five Piano Concertos by Prokofiev under direction of Antoni Wit with the soloist Kun Woo Paik were awarded the Diapason d&apos;Or and the Grand Prix du Disque de la Nouvelle Académie du Disque 1992 and the recording of Turangalila Symphony by Olivier Messiaen under Antoni Wit was awarded the 2002 Cannes Classical Award. Recently a record for DUX with works of Krzysztof Penderecki (Capriccio for violin and orchestra, De natura sonoris no. 2 for the piano and orchestra Resurrection) with participation of NOSPR as well as soloists Beata Bilińska and Patrycja Piekutowska conducted by the composer received prestigious MIDEM Classical Award 2008 in the category of Contemporary Music.</string>
		<string>Schlesisches Museum (Muzeum Śląskie) ist das bekannteste Museum der Stadt Katowice. Das Museum wurde kraft des Beschlusses des Schlesischen Parlamentes (Sejm Śląski), am 23. Januar 1929 gegründet. Anfangs wurden die Exponate im Gebäude des Schlesischen Parlamentes ausgestellt, gleichzeitig wurde jedoch 1936 mit der Errichtung des modernen, repräsentativen Neubaus, nach dem Projekt des Architekten Karol Schayer, für das Museum begonnen. Die Eröffnung war auf Frühjahr 1940 vorgesehen. Nach dem Vorschlag des Direktors des Landesmuseums Beuthen, Franz Pfützenreiter (1888–1968) wurde das fast fertige Gebäude „als Denkmal des polnisch-jüdischen Hochmuts“ 1941–1944 abgebrochen. Es blieb nur der Wohnflügel übrig. Die heilgebliebenen Exponate wurden teilweise geraubt und zum Teil nach Beuthen (Bytom), in das dort ansässige Oberschlesische Landesmuseum geschafft worden. Es wurde auch die Große Synagoge an der ul. Mickiewicza (Mickiewicz-Str.) und das jüdische Viertel der Stadt in Brand gesetzt. Nach dem Krieg gab es weder die nötigen finanziellen Mittel noch den guten Willen der kommunistischen Zentralregierung das Museum, das die Autonomiebestrebungen Schlesiens verkörperte wiederherzurichten. An seiner Stelle errichtete man ein Gewerkschaftsgebäude. Erst 1984 gab man dem Bevölkerungsdruck nach und gründete das Schlesische Museum neu, größtenteils mit neuen Exponaten. Allerdings baute man nicht das Gebäude Schayers wieder auf, sondern quartierte das Museum vorläufig in ein Neurenaissancegebäude, das ehemalige Grand Hotel Wiener, an der al. Korfantego 3, das zu dieser Zeit gar nicht für ein Museum geeignet und z.T. renovierungsbedürftig war. Man hat klein, mit nur einem Ausstellungszimmer angefangen, und führte gleichzeitig die nötigen Arbeiten am Gebäude durch, die erst 1992, nach der politischen Wende, beendet wurden. Zu den heutigen Sammlungen des Museums zählen über 75.000, vor allem ethnologische und archäologische Exponate, die mit der Stadt und Region Oberschlesien zusammenhängen und eine Gemäldegalerie der polnischen Malerei des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts, die 233 Kunstwerke umfasst. Darüber hinaus werden im Museum verschiedene Sonderausstellungen gezeigt, die thematisch auch andere Regionen betreffen können.

Seit Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts wurden öffentlich Pläne diskutiert, das Museum in ein neues, größeres Gebäude umzusiedeln. Der geplante neue Standort ist das Gelände der ehemaligen „Zeche Katowice“. Am 15. Juni 2007 wurde der Architektenwettbewerb für den Neubau des Museums entschieden. Einstimmig wurde das Projekt der Architekten Riegler Riewe aus Graz, Österreich zum Sieger erklärt. Der Bau begann 2011 und wurde 2014 abgeschlossen.[1] Die Gesamtkosten sollen sich auf 324 Mio. Złoty belaufen. Das neue Museumsgebäude umfasst sieben Stockwerke, davon drei unterirdische. Es wurden die Einrichtungen des stillgelegten Bergwerkes integriert.</string>
